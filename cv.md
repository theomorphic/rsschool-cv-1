### About me
I always wanted to be a programmer, but unfortunately, I had to study to be an accountant. When I worked as an accountant, I used the 1C program. One day I didn't have enough functions to calculate taxes, so I decided to study the 1C program as a programmer. And I really liked it! It was an interesting experience, after that I couldn't work as an accountant. This job has become uninteresting to me. I started looking for myself in a new industry. I've always liked games and drawing, design. Last year I had experience as a graphic designer, I became interested in website layout and so I came to web development. Yes, it may sound kind of girly, but I love everything beautiful, so website development is a very beautiful area of programming for me.
